        <h2>Co-Curricular & Extra Curricular</h2>
        <p>
          Where Passion is Discovered, Character is Built, and Talents Shine.
        </p>
        <p>
          At IMS, we believe that a child's education extends far beyond the
          classroom walls. Our rich and diverse programme of co-curricular and
          extra-curricular activities is a core part of our holistic
          philosophy. These activities provide a vital platform for students to
          explore their interests, develop essential life skills, build
          confidence, and form lasting friendships, all within our supportive
          and values-led environment.

        <h3>1. English Communication Program</h3>
        <p>
          Find Your Voice, Shape Your Future.
        </p>
        <p>
          At Islamic Mission School, we believe that eloquent and confident
          communication is a cornerstone of success. Our dedicated English
          Communication program is designed to empower students with the skills
          to articulate their ideas with clarity, conviction, and respect. In
          today's interconnected world, the ability to communicate effectively
          in English opens doors to global opportunities. It is more than just
          grammar and vocabulary; it is about critical thinking, persuasive
          argumentation, and confident self-expression. Our program is
          meticulously crafted to transform students into articulate speakers
          and thoughtful listeners, preparing them for higher education and
          professional excellence.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have dedicated two specialized periods solely to the practical
          mastery of English communication. This focused approach allows for
          deep, immersive learning in a variety of engaging formats:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Panel Discussion</strong> — Students learn the art of
            collaborative dialogue, active listening, and respectful structured
            debate.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Speech & Public Speaking</strong> — From crafting narrative
            to mastering delivery, students build confidence and presence.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Debate</strong> — Students sharpen reasoning, research, and
            quick thinking through structured argumentative formats.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Extempore</strong> — Prepares students for spontaneous
            speaking and on‑their‑feet clarity.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Arabic Communication Program</h3>
        <p>
          Connect with the Language of Faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          Arabic is not just a language to be learned, but a key to a deeper
          spiritual understanding. Our specialized Arabic Communication program
          opens the door to the profound beauty of the Quran and the rich
          heritage of Islamic scholarship.
        </p>
        <p>
          While we maintain a rigorous standard Arabic curriculum, we go a
          step further by dedicating two specialized periods each week solely to
          Arabic Communication. This focused initiative ensures that students
          move from theoretical knowledge to practical application.
